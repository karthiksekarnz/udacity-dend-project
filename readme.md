## Udacity DataEngineering capstone project
This the capstone project for Udacity DataEngineering nanodegree program.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to apply the learning from the Udacity Data engineering course. 

### Overview
This is a fictional annual movie awards hosted by Sparkademy awards.<br>
Spakademy wants to identify top movies to award based on IMDB users' votes.

As a data engineer I was asked to build a data model from the datasets, so they can analyse the data and identify the top rated movies.
I am using Spark to build a datalake by writing parquet tables into S3. Full description of the datasets are below.

### Project write up
- #### Choice of tools
    I have chosen Spark as my tool and build a data lake with parquet files in S3. The reason I have chosen these tools
    is that the IMDB dataset is very huge and ratings keep changing all the time. Had I chosen a data warehouse like Redshift, I need to run a lot of update queries.
- #### Scheduling
    I'd use Airflow to schedule every morning 7am potentially download the IMDB and TMDB datasets use of AWS Lambda and then do the loading and transforming of the CSVs into parquet files.
- #### The data was increased by 100x?
    The IMDB dataset is huge, some csv files contains as much as 50 Million records. I have worked only with a subset of this dataset.<br> 
    I couldn't use Spark to it's full potential in the Udacity workspace, I was getting out of memory errors.<br>
    I'll use EMR to have Spark clusters and scale accordingly. <br>
    I'll also try to use serverless solution like AWS Glue.
- #### Challenges
  The challenge with the TMDB dataset is it contains a lot of small JSON files.<br>
  It turned out that Spark seem to be efficient with few big files rather than a lot of small files.<br>
  I was not able to use AWS Glue with the Udacity account, I'll use AWS glue crawler for this use case in future.
- #### Sample analysis
  Extracting the top movies of the previous year through IMDB dataset and TMDB.<br>
The top 10 most voted american english movies of 2021 are below.

```
#### Data quality checks
- Filtering out adult movies
- Check if data row exists
- Filter by language and region
- Usage of aggregate function collect_list for titles during retrieval of top 10 movies.<br>
Movies' working title and popular title share the same imdb id. 

### IMDB dataset
The full description of the IMDB dataset can be found here [https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)

Each dataset is contained in a gzipped, tab-separated-values (TSV) formatted file in the UTF-8 character set.<br>
The available datasets are as follows:<br>
- **title.basics.tsv.gz** <br>
Contains all types of titles available in IMDB (e.g. movie, tv series, video game, etc) <br>~8.8M records
- **title.akas.tsv.gz** <br>
Contains additional information about titles (e.g: language, isOriginalTitle, etc.)
- **title.principals.tsv.gz** <br> ~49.7M â€“ Contains the principal cast/crew for titles
- **title.ratings.tsv.gz** <br>
Contains the IMDb rating and votes information for titles<br>
~1.22M records
- **name.basics.tsv.gz**<br>
Contains the following information for names<br>
~11.4M records
  
### TMDB data set
The TMDB dataset is retrieved from kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edgartanaka1/tmdb-movies-and-series](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edgartanaka1/tmdb-movies-and-series)
There are over 526,000 movies json files.

### Star schema
Read the CSV files from IMDB input data

- **movies_titles** - movie titles that are split by language/subfolder by years
- **movies_details** - movie details like titles - split language/subfolder by years
- **movies_ratings** - movie ratings from both imdb & tmdb - split language/subfolder by years
- **movies_finances** - movie's finance details like revenue and budget
- **movies_principal_crew** - movies' principal cast and crew.
- **movies_crew_names** - Names of the member's of the cast and crew.
